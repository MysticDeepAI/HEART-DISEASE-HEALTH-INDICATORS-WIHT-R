## Project Description

This project aims to develop a binary classification model to predict the probability of having a heart attack using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. Various models were implemented and compared, applying feature selection and optimization methods to identify the best-performing model.

## Repository Contents

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A comprehensive analysis of categorical and numerical variables was conducted to understand the dataset dynamics and detect potential outliers.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes normalization of numerical variables and one-hot encoding of categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.
- **Logistic Regression Models**: Models were implemented using forward selection and backward selection to optimize the selection of predictor variables.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparison of models using performance metrics such as AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 Score.
- **Handling Class Imbalance**: Given that the response variable is imbalanced, strategies were discussed and applied to mitigate this issue and improve model performance.

## Conclusions

- **Identification of Variables**: Categorical and numerical variables were correctly identified, and a statistical analysis was conducted to detect outliers.
- **Model Optimization**: Forward selection resulted in a more parsimonious model with comparable performance to the full model.
- **Handling Imbalance**: The elimination of imbalanced features was justified, and appropriate techniques were applied to balance the classes, contributing to improved model predictive capability.
